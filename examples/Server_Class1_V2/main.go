// This example shows how to set up a class 1 IO connection.  To support multiple connections you should use the "Ethernet Bridge" module
// in the IO tree.  Then you should add one "CIP Mdoule" per virtual IO rack position.
//
// I think multiple readers should work.  Multiple writers would also appear to work but they would step on each other.
//
// You should create your own class that fulfills the TagProvider interface with the IORead and IOWrite methods completed where you handle the
// serializing and deserializing of data properly.
//
// I think you should be able to have class 3 tag providers AND class 1 tag providers at the same time for the same path, BUT you'll have to
// combine their logic into a single class since the router will resolve all messages to the same place.  For this reason it might be easiest
// to keep class 3 tag providers and class 1 tag providers segregated to different "slots" on the "backplane"
//
// Note that you won't be able to have multiple servers on a single computer.  They bind to the EIP ports on TCP and UDP so you'll need
// to multiplex multiple connections through one program.
//
// In the current inarnation of this server it doesn't matter what assembly instance IDs you select in the controller, although you could create your own
// TagProvider that changed behavior based on that.
