// This example shows a good way to continuously poll a PLC and get the data back into your main program without having to worry about
// reconnect logic, etc...
//
// Obviously this won't work for every scenario but it is a pretty solid foundation for simple things.
//
// The basic gist is that we create a channel and kick a goroutine off to pump data into that channel at a specified rate
// as the PLC is polled.  Then the main program can just receive on that channel to get fresh PLC data.
